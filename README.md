# Final-Project-AIT

For now I have two forms which get the data and add it to the database. 

I had a lot of difficulty connecting mongo to the code - hence the delay in submission. 

To run the code - launch the app.mjs

The project is similarly structured to HW 04 for now. 



Next steps would include: 
1) Using react to structure the project
2) implement authentication
3)
